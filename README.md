<summary>Version 3 Short Notes:</summary>
Version 3.0 brings minor API changes along with major performance improvements and fixes. We have minimized changes to existing APIs.

Note: [react18-themes](https://github.com/react18-tools/react18-themes/) will now be maintained as `nextjs-themes`, as server-specific APIs are no longer needed.

## FAQ

**Do I need to use CSS variables with this library?**

No. You can hard code values for every class:

```css
.my-class {
  color: #555;
}

[data-theme="dark"] .my-class {
  color: white;
}
```

**Why is `resolvedTheme` and `resolvedColorScheme` necessary?**

To reflect the System theme preference and forced theme/colorScheme pages in your UI. For instance, buttons or dropdowns indicating the current colorScheme should say "system" when the System colorScheme preference is active.

`resolvedTheme` is useful for modifying behavior or styles at runtime:

```js
const { resolvedTheme, resolvedColorScheme } = useTheme();
const background = getBackground(resolvedTheme);

<div style={{ color: resolvedColorScheme === 'dark' ? white : black, background }}>
```

Without `resolvedTheme`, you would only know the theme is "system", not what it resolved to.
