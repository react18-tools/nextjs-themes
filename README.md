<summary>Version 3 Short Notes:</summary>
Version 3.0 brings minor API changes along with major performance improvements and fixes. We have minimized changes to existing APIs.

Note: [react18-themes](https://github.com/react18-tools/react18-themes/) will now be maintained as `nextjs-themes`, as server-specific APIs are no longer needed.

## Getting Started

> See [Getting Started](./guides/getting-started.md)

> Want Lite Version? [![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/nextjs-themes-lite)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-themes-lite) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nextjs-themes-lite.svg?colorB=green)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-themes-lite) [![Downloads](https://img.jsdelivr.com/img.shields.io/npm/d18m/nextjs-themes-lite.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-themes-lite)
> In case you are using `r18gs` in your project, you may use lite version which requires `r18gs` as a peerDependency.

### With Tailwind

In `tailwind.config.js`, set the dark mode property to class:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
};
```

âš¡ðŸŽ‰Ready to use dark mode in Tailwind!

> Caution: Your class must be `"dark"`, which is the default value used in this library. Tailwind requires the class name `"dark"` for dark-theme.

Use dark-mode specific classes:

```tsx
<h1 className="text-black dark:text-white">
```

## Migration

## FAQ

**Do I need to use CSS variables with this library?**

No. You can hard code values for every class:

```css
.my-class {
  color: #555;
}

[data-theme="dark"] .my-class {
  color: white;
}
```

**Why is `resolvedTheme` and `resolvedColorScheme` necessary?**

To reflect the System theme preference and forced theme/colorScheme pages in your UI. For instance, buttons or dropdowns indicating the current colorScheme should say "system" when the System colorScheme preference is active.

`resolvedTheme` is useful for modifying behavior or styles at runtime:

```js
const { resolvedTheme, resolvedColorScheme } = useTheme();
const background = getBackground(resolvedTheme);

<div style={{ color: resolvedColorScheme === 'dark' ? white : black, background }}>
```

Without `resolvedTheme`, you would only know the theme is "system", not what it resolved to.
